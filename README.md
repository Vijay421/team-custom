## NAVBAR
We used grid for the navbar because this way we could easily align the icons and place them in the center in the navbar.
We tried using flexbox but grid was a better option.


## HEADER
The headers is made with flexbox because it was the best way to position the elements.


## PAYMENT SECTION
The payment section is made with flexbox because you can scroll down to see al the payments and it was a easy way to align the payment boxes.
